LUA project

Most likely dropped indefinitely as I now use Love2D to make projects and learn about the language.

I wanna keep this code and return to it in a while, once I feel like i've reached levels above this. May take a long time, but it'll be fun whenever it happens.


(Thoughts as Update Notes)

Update Notes 12/19/2023:
* After the mentoring was over (somewhere in November 2023) I dedicated my time to Python through [Boot.dev](http://boot.dev "Title")
* I learned about cookbooks from that aforementioned course's community and realized I could've done something similar rather than slapping comments on what is either a good or bad calls/implementation, which is not helpful and instead very confusing.
* Now that my main coding language is Python, I realize that I prefer doing OOP with Lua because I find it syntactically pleasing to write and figure out than Python. However I currently feel like Python and OOP concepts can be taken to levels way past the point where Lua will probably hit a roadblock due to the language's specific usage.
* While I have been putting Lua aside and focused on Python, my overall comprehension of programming concepts improved and I definitely want to test myself by writing a decent enough cookbook which would be maintained to help stay fluent with Lua and eventually master it.
